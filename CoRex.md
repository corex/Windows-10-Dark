# Changes

I love this theme, but in my oppinion it has flaws. It does not work when you have many windows and they overlap. It is kind a hard to separate each window.

It is not the themes fault itself and the author made an excellent work to match it to Windows 10.

I have some wishes so I made changes that tries to solve this.

## Borders
Since I am using XFCE4 I have changed the border color for the active windows, so it os easier to focus on the active window.

## Colors
- Border #596eb5 - a light blue color.

All files under /xfwm4 that has the color #141414 and ends in "-active", "-prelight" and "-pressed", has been updated with the new color code.
