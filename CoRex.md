# Changes

I love this theme, but in my oppinion it has flaws. It does not work when you have many windows and they overlap. It is kind a hard to separate each window.

It is not the themes fault itself and the author made an excellent work to match it to Windows 10.

I have some wishes so I made changes that tries to solve this.

## Borders
- I have changed the border color for the active window, so it os easier to spot.

## Colors
- Border #596eb5 - a light blue color.

## Build
To build, simply run build.sh and it will create a tar file in parent directory suffixed with "-CoRex".
